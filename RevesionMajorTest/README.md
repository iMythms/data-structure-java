# RevesionMajorTest – Sorting Algorithms

A collection of elementary sorting algorithm implementations used for practice and testing.

## Files
- **binarySearch.java** – Classic binary search on a sorted integer array.
- **bubbleSort.java** – Simple bubble sort implementation with swap counting.
- **insertionSort.java** – Standard insertion sort algorithm.
- **linearSerach.java** – Linear search (note typo retained from original file name).
- **selectionSort.java** – Selection sort implementation.

These programs illustrate basic algorithmic thinking and serve as a reference for comparison of time complexities.
