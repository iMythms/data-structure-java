# Lab15 – Queue Example

This lab demonstrates the use of a classic queue data structure in Java. The implementation includes a generic `Queue` class with basic enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations, along with a small driver program to exercise the queue.

## Files
- `QueueEx1.java` – Defines a generic `Queue<T>` class with typical queue methods and internal array handling.
- `QueueEx1App.java` – A simple console application that creates a queue, performs several operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek), and prints the results.

The exercises illustrate how to manage head/tail indices, handle overflow, and provide clear output of queue state.
