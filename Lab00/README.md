# Lab00 – Basic Classes

This lab introduces fundamental object‑oriented concepts in Java. It contains simple classes that model real‑world entities and demonstrate constructors, fields, methods, and basic testing.

## Files
- **Area.java** – Represents a geometric area with width and height, includes a method to compute the area.
- **DrivingLicense.java** – Models a driving license with holder name, license number, and expiration date.
- **Employee.java** – Simple employee class with name, id, and salary fields plus a `toString` method.
- **EmployeeTest.java** – JUnit style test (or main method) that creates `Employee` instances and prints their details.
- **Universe.java** – Example class that prints a fun message, illustrating a static method and program entry point.
