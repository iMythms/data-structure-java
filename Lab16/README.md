# Lab16 – Binary Search Tree

This lab implements a classic binary search tree (BST) and demonstrates traversal techniques.

## Files
- `BST.java` – Node class with `int key` and left/right children, insertion, search, and deletion methods.
- `BinarySearchTreeTraversal.java` – Contains `inorder`, `preorder`, and `postorder` traversal methods that print node keys.
- `Node.java` – Simple data holder used by `BST` (may be duplicated for educational clarity).

The exercises show how to build a BST, insert values, and traverse it in different orders, reinforcing tree concepts.
